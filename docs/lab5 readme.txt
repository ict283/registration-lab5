There are two data files provided in data. You need to keep the files
in data.

Use "data/MetData-31-3.csv" first. 

Once you have got your program working, use the larger .csv data file. 
This larger file is for assignment 1. Assignment 1 should also work 
with the smaller data file.

Nesting and templates has code example to show further usage of
templates as well as how to access data from nested classes.
The data is always accessed via a public get method. 
Use the debugger to single-step through each line of code
to trace the sequence of calls made.
